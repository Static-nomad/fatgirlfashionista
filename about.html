  <h1 id="about"> About</h1>
  <p id="reason">This site was created after I had a terrible (racist) experience at a Torrid in North Austin in October of 2019. After waiting for the company to make things right or at least offer to do anything, I decided to never give them my business EVER again.  I began searching for other retailers that offer plus size fashions. I want other plus-sized folks to know that there are other options out there. Go get your style on!</p>
